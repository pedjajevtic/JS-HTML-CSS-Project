            <h1> 20 years of iToucan! </h1>
            <span class="crta13"></span>  
              <p> Tonight we are celebrating our company’s 20th anniversary and I value you all who are sharing this special day with me. It is rightly said that it doesn’t matter where you go in your life, but what matters the most is whom you have beside you all the way. It’s a pleasure for me to invite you all to the milestone dinner of iToucan’s 20th anniversary. 2018 was a notable year for us for many reasons. We initiated this organization with the blessings of our Mom, Dad and Almighty. It’s due to their blessings that we have expanded our organization to this extent that we are celebrating 20 years of its commencement.
              <br><br>
              These 20 years can be defined as a kaleidoscope of happy and best memories of my life, new friendship and relationships. I have found my new friends in terms of my employees who have worked day and night to make this day possible for me. Over the last fifteen years, this business has undergone massive changes like restructuring, globalization etc but our organization has become stronger and efficient than ever before. I have had my employees who were, are and will always be my intellectual assets that have always stood by my side. I am lucky to have such a fantastic team of dedicated and loyal employees.
              <br><br>
              On this auspicious day, I promise all my employees to be friendly and supportive to them as I have been in these past years. I promise to help you all whenever necessary. So let’s look forward to another amazing year with strong professional relationships even further and to take this company to reach greater heights. As we all took time to express gratitude and to celebrate these fantastic 20 years gone by, let’s turn eagerly to the years that lie ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being a part of this special day. We are grateful to you for taking your time out from your busy schedules and to help us in making our 20th anniversary, more memorable.
              <br><br>
              Huge thanks to all! 
              <br>
